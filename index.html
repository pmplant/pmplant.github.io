            <dt><b>Amazon Web Services — Software Development Engineer</b></dt>
            <dt>November 2019 - present, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">aws.amazon.com</a></dt>
            <dd>I work on native AWS (100% cloud based) services in TypeScript and Java, and create deployment pipelines and infrastructure in CDK. 
                I have done substantial work spearheading the adoption of CDK in my team and have implemented a framework to streamline 
                the creation of new CDK pipelines and support best practices, like isolated developer deployments. I was a contributer to the launch 
                of Amazon Connect Real Time Contact Lens, where I worked across teams to implement the API connecting the UI to the backend.
                I have done substantial work validating a custom Redis based throttling solution our team developed, 
                diagnosed why the solution did not work as intended, and implemented a new client for us to use as a replacement. 
                And other misc. ops, customer support, ops tools, and region launches.</dd>
            <dt><b>Polaris Motion — Software Developer</b></dt>
            <dt>June 2016 - September 2017, <a href="pmdi.com">pmdi.com</a></dt>
            <dd>I worked in C and C++ on the server for their CNC control device. I lead a major refactoring of the code base to support
                new hardware platforms. I designed and implemented the software for a high speed spindle controller prototype for a client. 
                I developed a custom framework for clients to implement their own monitoring logic using callbacks in C. And other misc. 
                customer support, technical writing.</dd>
            <dt><b>Netgear Canada — Software Developer Coop</b></dt>
            <dt>January 2015 - December 2015, <a href="www.netgear.com">netgear.com</a></dt>
            <dd>I wrote firmware in C for Aircard mobile hotspot devices and performed basic electronics troubleshooting. 
                I performed troubleshooting on batteries from various suppliers and implemented support for them into the Aircard firmware. 
                I wrote scripts to automate battery tests, monitor battery charge cycles, and produce reports for review. 
                I implemented a bootloader patch to fix dead battery charging on devices which did not support it in hardware. 
                And other misc. work.</dd>
