    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Amazon Web Services — Software Development Engineer</h3>
    <p>November 2019 - present, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">aws.amazon.com</a></p>
    <p>I work on Contact Search for Amazon Connect. I work on native AWS (100% cloud based) services in
        TypeScript and Java, front-end development in React,
        and CI/CD pipelines
        and infrastructure in CDK.
        I spearheaded the adoption of CDK in my team and have implemented a
        framework to streamline
        the creation of new CDK pipelines and support best practices, like isolated developer deployments. I was
        a contributor to the launch
        of Amazon Connect Real Time Contact Lens, where I worked across teams to implement the API connecting
        the UI to the backend.
        I have done substantial work validating a custom Redis based throttling solution our team developed,
        diagnosed why the solution did not work as intended, and implemented a new client for us to use as a
        replacement.
        And other misc. ops, customer support, ops tools, and region launches.</p>
    <h3>Polaris Motion — Software Developer</h3>
    <p>June 2016 - September 2017, <a href="pmdi.com">pmdi.com</a></p>
    <p>I worked in C and C++ on the linux server for the Polaris Motion Control System. I lead a major
        refactoring of
        the code
        base to support
        new hardware platforms. I designed and implemented the software for a high speed spindle controller
        prototype for a client.
        I developed a custom framework for clients to implement their own monitoring logic using callbacks in C.
        And other misc.
        customer support, technical writing.</p>
    <h3>Netgear Canada — Software Developer Coop</h3>
    <p>January 2015 - December 2015, <a href="www.netgear.com">netgear.com</a></p>
    <p>I wrote firmware in C for Aircard mobile hotspot devices and performed basic electronics
        work.
        I performed troubleshooting on batteries from various suppliers and implemented support for them into
        the Aircard firmware.
        I wrote scripts to automate battery tests, monitor battery charge cycles, and produce reports for
        review.
        I implemented a bootloader patch to fix dead battery charging on devices which did not support it in
        hardware.
        And other misc. work.</p>
